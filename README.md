# Crop-Yield-Prediction-System

The proposed system aims at predicting or forecasting the crop yield by learning the past data of the farming land. By considering various factors such as soil conditions, rainfall, temperature, yield and other entities the system builds a predicting a model using machine learning techniques. Here we make use of several an ML and Deep Learning based models, the most efficient being Random Forest, SVM & CNN ensemble model, and Decision Tree & CNN ensemble model. Performance is evaluated based on predicted accuracy and is compared with the base models.
